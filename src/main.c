// This project is made to learn c more deeply, 
// refresh knowledge and implementation details of common data structures
// refresh memory on sorting algorithms
// learn how to setup project with make, cmake and allow basic testing capabilities

// Data structures to implement:
//   dynamic_array, stack, queue, dequeue, linked list
//   trees, binary-trees, red-black trees, min- and max-heap
//   graphs with nodes and edges able to use search algorithms
//   hash table, hash set, hash map
